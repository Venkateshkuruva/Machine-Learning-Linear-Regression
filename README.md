# 📊 Salary Prediction using Simple Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to implement a **Simple Linear Regression** model using Python and scikit-learn to predict an employee’s **Salary** based on their **Years of Experience**.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **File:** `Salary_Data.csv`
- **Features:**
  - `YearsExperience`
  - `Salary`
- The dataset contains salary data of employees and their years of experience.

---

## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. Import libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`.
2. Load the dataset using `pandas`.
3. Split the data into **features (X)** and **target (y)**.
4. Split the dataset into **training and testing sets**.
5. Fit a **Linear Regression** model on the training data.
6. Predict the results for the test data.
7. Visualize the predictions with a regression line.
